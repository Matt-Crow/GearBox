# GearBox release 2 interview
This is a fun thought expirament where I interview myself to see what I want to include in GearBox release 2.

## QA

1. **How do you feel about the first release of GearBox?** I'm impressed with the technical side of things, especially given the quick turnaround time. The core gameplay loop is there, it just has to be fleshed out a bit more. Now that you're done with a lot of the core systems, it'd be great if we could start realizing the game's "toolboxy" vision.

2. **Any suggestions on how the core gameplay loop could be fleshed out?** We probably just need more content to take players all the way to max level. It's currently a bit difficult to feel a sense of progression when you're only going from level 1 to 3.

3. **Would this additional content be tailor-made or procedurally generated?** Probably a mix of both: legendary gear especially should feel special, but procedural generation will give players more tools to play with.

4. **What do you think of adding a content-creation studio to the site so we can design content more efficiently?** That would help a lot in the long run, but I'd imagine it's a huge time sink. You can do that if you think we could ship release 2 in time, but I wouldn't want it to distract from more important features.

5. **Any other large features you'd want us to focus on this release?** Probably dungeons or passive abilities.

6. **Looks like we already have passive abilities in the backlog, but could you provide a high-level overview of what you envision for dungeons?** Probably just a series of rooms and corridors, filled with monsters and a boss at the end. This will give players a goal to achieve instead of waiting around and farming the same enemy over and over again.

7. **Going back to your first point, can you elaborate on your "toolboxy" vision for the game?** I want the game to feel like its providing the player with a lot of different tools they can use to overcome challenges it throws at them. A player should feel like they're building their own character instead of just using whatever's best. Right about now, you only really have control over your weapon and armor, so I'd like more equipment slots to fill.

8. **Have you decided on a theme for the game yet? This would help us decide what sort of content to create.** Let's leave it ambiguous for now; I haven't decided on whether I want the player to be a robot, and Archean, or something else entirely.

9. **Are there any pain points in the game you'd like to address in this release?** The inventory can get a bit crowded, so I think we need to tone down the amount of loot players are getting. Either that or we could add something for them to sink their excess gear into. Maybe enemies should drop crafting materials instead of the equipment itself? That'd clean things up a bit, but the crafting menu would get rather long. This seems like a large change, so maybe you can hold off unless you have a lot of time.

10. **Is there anything else in the backlog that stands out to you as a good candidate for this release?** I'd imagine players will need to upgrade their gear quite a bit once they can go to level 20, so #88 would come in handy.
